# IQT @ Sussex

Welcome to the IQT Sussex 'Organization' on github. Our aim is to develop new quantum technologies, in particular, the ion trap quantum computer. For this purpose our research focuses on applied experimental quantum information science and development of new scalable methods to build ion trap arrays and the next generation of large scale entanglement. 

#### Most of our code is PRIVATE, but you can read about our work at [sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/)
